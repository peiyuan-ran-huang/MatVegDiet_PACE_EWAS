This project is an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to examine cord blood DNA methylation in relation to maternal vegetarian/plant-based diets, which is part of my main PhD project.
The EWAS was conducted within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium (https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/iidl/pi/gen-epi/pace).
This repo includes the analysis plan and associated supplementary files and the template code circulated to PACE cohorts.
